Project Realized for devacademy.ro in Java.

Project uses SQLite database (jar added to the archive, please include when importing).

The project has UI console in order to perform the required actions for the project.
The Saved queries are saved only to a list for each run of the application.

I haven't created the Profile/Query class (as it would have contained only one field the query)
